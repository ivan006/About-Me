### Flexi-merce
> This is a pet project which aims to demonstrate how e-commerce systems can be much more flexible.

This app uses Laravel and I developed every part of it.


### Price correction report
> This helps tour operators to keep track of the supplier pricing information that needs updating in their system.

Here I developed the business logic and template. The data loads through ajax in order to avoid page reloads when browsing the price correction list.

### Booking dashboard template
> This will help tour operators to customize trips for their clients.

<a href="booking-dashboard-template/">Demo</a>

I helped to develop this template. I also helped with some of the back end functionality. The back end functionality specifically was the "Soon to travel" and  "Recent bookings" lists that are located in the right sidebar.
